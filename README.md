<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 🎯 About The Project

**zippr** is a personal exploration into the core systems that make a game engine—entity composition, rendering, input, resources, and configuration. While full-featured engines offer powerful abstractions, they often sacrifice the control and clarity that comes from writing code from scratch. The goal is to learn by building these pieces end-to-end and shape a cohesive toolkit for video games and other interactive applications.

> 💡 This is intended to be a personal passion project. As such, I won't be open to outside contributions. I still encourage anyone who finds value in this project to pick it up and modify it to their needs.

<!-- GUIDING PRINCIPLES -->
## 🧭 Guiding Principles

**zippr** will start by using a few best-in-class dependencies. This will allow the toolkit to become usable much faster. Over time, I will implement my own solutions to become dependency-free.

### ✨ Goals:
- 🚀 Ship usable slices early
- 🧩 Small, composable modules over monoliths
- ⚡ Performance-aware by design

### 🎯 Scope:
- 🎨 2D / 2.5D initially, with 3D in the future

### ❌ Non-Goals:
- 🛠️ Full-blown engine editor: _zippr will remain a code first library_ 
- 🌐 Built-in networking or online services: _These may be explored later but are not a part of the immediate vision_

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: 🚀 Leverage raylib, a data-serialization library, and possibly an ECS library
- **Phase 2**: 🔧 Wrap external dependencies behind stable interfaces and make them replaceable
- **Phase 3**: 🎮 Expand game-centric features
  - _(inventory systems, pathfinding algorithms, world/map generation, etc)_
- **Phase 4**: ⚡ Selectively replace dependency abstractions with custom solutions
